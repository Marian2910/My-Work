# My-projects
In this repository, you will find 6 projects that I have worked on.

The first project is the most recent one developed last summer during the Endava Summer Apprentice program. It's a ticket management app for various events, featuring a layered architecture implemented with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The backend is composed of two parts: Java with SpringBoot and C# with .Net. The app utilizes a relational database through the data access layer. On the frontend, it is primarily built using JavaScript. Notably, the application includes a searching feature on the frontend for events. Additionally, it follows a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for event registration (orders).

The second project is a Cinema management system developed in Python during my first year of university. It is a simplistic console-based application with basic features.

The third project is a candy vending machine developed in C++. The vending machine can give change and dispense the selected candy.

The fourth project is a console-based social network application developed in C++. Users can create accounts, add friends, and send messages to each other.

The fifth project is also a social network application, but with a graphical user interface developed in Java. The application stores data in a database and has more advanced features than the previous console-based social network.

The last project is a collection of assembly language problems that I have solved during my laboratory classes.

Each of these projects showcases my programming skills and the various programming languages that I have worked with. Feel free to explore the projects and provide any feedback or suggestions.
